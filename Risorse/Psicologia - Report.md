## Struttura
#### Titolo
Integrated care and digital technologies for the management of mental health and comorbidities.
#### 1. Abstract
This report explores the challenges faced by the current healthcare system in addressing chronic pathological conditions, which have become more prevalent in Western society over the past few decades due to various factors, such as increased accessibility to hyper-palatable foods and inadequate physical activity. The report emphasizes the need for a shift towards a multi-faceted, integrated, and continuous model of care to overcome the challenges presented by chronic diseases. The study employed original papers, reviews, and information about the present healthcare system from different databases to investigate the importance of a healthy doctor-patient relationship, the need for a system capable of ensuring the former, and the necessity of utilizing new technological tools to support this shift in healthcare delivery. The report shows that the trust and communication between a physician and a patient are crucial in establishing a healthy doctor-patient relationship. Additionally, the report proposes a framework for an integrated care system and highlights the areas that need to be addressed, such as service delivery, leadership, workforce, finances, technology, and research.
#### 2. Introduction
Over the past few decades, Western society has experienced a significant rise in the prevalence of chronic pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (5). Contributing factors include inadequate physical activity resulting from work conditions, increased accessibility to hyper-palatable foods (7), and overall lifestyle conditions that promote the development of these diseases. While healthcare providers are capable of addressing these conditions individually, they may not be equipped to do so optimally. It is well established that the diagnosis of chronically ill individuals often includes co-morbidities affecting different systems (5), e.g., chronic pain increases the risk of developing mental illnesses (4,6). This presents a challenge for current healthcare systems, which are not equipped to holistically evaluate patients within their environment or to guarantee seamless transitions between different levels of care. These factors and the ease of access to medical information have contributed to a widespread mistrust of medical practitioners, which complicates the already challenging physician-patient relationship. To overcome these challenges, cutting-edge technologies and a proper framework are essential. This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient context and to identify the necessary changes to shift towards a multi-faceted, integrated, and continuous model of care with the goal of enhancing the relationship between the patient and their healthcare provider.

#### 4. Method
Original papers, reviews and information about the present structure of healthcare systems have been chosen using scholar, PubMed and Elsevier databases between 1st January 2018 and 1st January 2023. Overall the objects of research were the effects of integrated care (IC) and technologies on healthcare systems.
Keywords were: Continuity of Care, e-Health, m-Health, Integrated care, Multi-Morbidity, Mental health, Doctor-Patient relationship

#### 5. Results
The research was driven by three main questions: the importance of a healthy doctor-patient relationship, the need for a system capable of ensuring the former, and the necessity of utilising new technological tools to support this shift in healthcare delivery

##### 5.1 The importance of trust and communication in a Doctor - Patient relationship (8)
###### 5.1.1 Trust
In the medical field, two distinct forms of trust can be differentiated: institutional trust and interpersonal trust. The former refers to the trust between an individual and the healthcare system or institution as a whole, while the latter is established through repeated interactions with healthcare providers. The determination of factors that contribute to the development of trust in the medical field is a complex and multifaceted process that is heavily influenced by the socio-cultural context. However, what emerges is that trust takes time to develop and requires ongoing efforts to maintain.
###### 5.1.2 Communication
The main point of establishing trust between a physician and a patient is effective communication. Despite having accurate information regarding the patient's health status and treatment plan, it is of no value if it is not effectively conveyed. Effective communication allows the physician to gather a comprehensive medical history from the patient, which is essential for both the diagnostic and treatment phases. The use of close-ended questions is crucial in order to summarise and help the patient to understand. Although it may seem straightforward, studies have shown that physicians often overestimate their communication abilities, and these skills can deteriorate over time due to various factors, including the high workload demands of healthcare personnel. The challenging working conditions faced by healthcare providers can negatively impact the development of a trustful relationship between the physician and the patient. 
###### 5.1.3 Patient satisfaction
Studies in the medical literature have shown that patients' dissatisfaction is often associated with inadequate communication during their medical interactions. To enhance the quality of the physician-patient relationship, it is important to provide training for healthcare staff on effective communication strategies and to regularly conduct patient satisfaction surveys. By doing so, the medical community can continuously strive to improve the doctor-patient interaction and ultimately increase contentment. Despite inconclusive evidence regarding the direct relationship between patient satisfaction and health outcomes in the literature, it is crucial to recognise that patients who possess a greater degree of trust in their physician exhibit more favourable health behaviours, fewer symptoms, and greater satisfaction with their treatment. In the long term, such factors may indirectly lead to improvements in the aforementioned outcomes.
###### 5.1.4 The relationship with healthcare quality
The assessment of care quality must take into account patient satisfaction, which can be efficiently evaluated through reports of patient experiences. High levels of patient satisfaction have been associated in the literature with shorter hospital stays, lower readmission rates, and higher surgical quality, providing a valuable indicator of healthcare system efficiency. However, blind faith from either party should be avoided, and informed consent should be confirmed through patient queries to ensure the reliability of the process.

##### 5.2  The framework for an integrated care system (3)

In light of the limited current literature (2) and the recent initiation of government investments towards the transition to IC models (3), a thorough understanding of the guiding intentions and framework for this process was found essential. Key areas of analysis include service delivery, leadership, workforce, finances, technology and research. It is imperative to acknowledge that each of these areas encompasses varying levels of complexity, as determined by the distinctions between micro, meso, and macro levels
![[SELFIE FRAMEWORK.jpg]]
###### 5.2.1 Service delivery
In an IC model of care, the patient plays an active role in their own health and must have a sufficient level of health literacy to comprehend the reasons for the lifestyle changes prescribed by their provider. They often need to develop new coping strategies for their pain, engage in medical discussions, and learn how to access care effectively. These considerations highlight the importance of healthcare systems equipping individuals with the necessary information and resources to participate in their healthcare journey. For patients with multiple comorbidities, reducing waiting and travel times and providing support are critical to overcome the challenges they face. Thus, a patient-centred approach that prioritises health literacy is essential in ensuring a bidirectional and effective collaboration between the patient and provider. 
###### 5.2.2 Leadership and governance
Effective management of responsibilities between physicians and patients is essential for a strong physician-patient relationship. To ensure independence, adherence to the therapeutic plan, and better outcomes, a shared decision-making process and partnership between the two parties is necessary. In this rapidly changing environment, proper planning to understand the required resources ahead of time is imperative. Providers should foster a culture that values ambition, vision, and shared goals. To ensure a continuous model of patient care, performance-oriented goals should serve as the foundation for management.
###### 5.2.3 Workforce 
The responsibilities of healthcare practitioners in a IC system extend beyond the clinical setting and encompass aspects of their personal and volunteer lives. As a result, it is important to have interdisciplinary teams that are tailored to the needs and backgrounds of the patient population. Each patient should have a dedicated coordinator who has a thorough understanding of their clinical status and serves as a liaison between specialised healthcare providers. The development of soft skills, such as effective communication, teamwork, and adaptability, should be achieved through targeted training and ongoing assessments. By implementing this structure, patients will feel a greater sense of security and have a more positive experience in the healthcare system.
###### 5.2.4 Finances
Patients in need should receive incentives to improve their quality of life such as gym memberships and workshops related to their condition. On a broader scale, the whole financial system should change in from a fee for service, that often creates distance between the provider and the patient to produce DRGs, to a bundled payment system: a single payment covers every service correlated to patient care over a defined period of time. 

##### 5.3 The role of technology 
The true binding element in an integrated care system is technology, which must aim to guarantee the maximum flow of useful information among all components of the healthcare system. Digital information systems, telemedicine applications, and remote monitoring reminders for various parameters are just some of the tools that can reinforce the highly dynamic structure of this framework for care. Although there are not many examples of IC systems to draw from, the use of some of these technologies has already become necessary in current healthcare systems, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fact that the context of application is different does not detract from the attempt to demonstrate their usefulness in an integrated structure. Once the organisational framework is understood, it is sufficient to analyse individual examples to find important practical applications.
###### 5.3.1 Telepsychiatry (TP) (1)
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the average mental health conditions rapidly declined due to loneliness and isolation. Those who had not previously experienced mental health issues began to demonstrate anxiety, stress, and depression, while those who already suffered from such conditions often experienced an aggravation of pre-existing symptoms due to non-adherence to therapeutic protocols. Given the unique aspects of psychiatry compared to other medical fields, such as minor differences between telemedicine and outpatient care, telepsychiatry has been extensively applied. The benefits are not only logistical but also personal, improving access to care, wait times, travel, and costs. Patients and providers feel more secure and benefit from greater flexibility. However, given the sensitivity of the subject, concerns arise. The loss of contact with the patient can hinder the decision-making process: non-verbal cues can be lost, visual contact may seem reduced or artificial, and some patients may be unsuitable based on their condition or technical limitations. Unlike cases of unsuitability (psychotic disorders, patients at risk of self-harm), there are numerous conditions where the results of remote application of psychiatric protocols have been positive. The conditions under consideration include depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Among the therapeutic methodologies used are cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and behavioural activation therapy, both of which can improve patient conditions. By using artificial intelligence to process large amounts of data and tools for virtual reality to make patients the protagonists of their own experiences, therapeutic possibilities can be expanded even further, providing flexibility and customisation for psychiatric patients, who can also reduce the social stigma typical of their condition.
###### 5.3.2 TP and digital interventions for the chronically ill (4)
In the specific case of chronic patients, the previous discussion can be applied even more precisely. In the case of multi morbidity, minimising the impact on the patient's lifestyle is crucial. Remote consultations and web-based interventions are currently the most effective measures but they have to be conducted in a guided, synchronised setting. Evidence regarding asynchronous therapies is limited, making it difficult to understand their effectiveness. Additionally, there are specific populations (such as the paediatric population) in which the models and type of intervention may need to be adjusted, so it is necessary to evaluate each case individually and analyse the subject first before seeking the best possible application.

#### Conclusions
As the digital era approaches, the healthcare system must adjust to a series of far-reaching changes that may revolutionise the current model of healthcare delivery. To successfully adapt to this transformation, the system must shift towards a patient-centric approach that integrates care and employs cutting-edge technologies to ensure that patients receive optimal treatment, regardless of their abilities and state of health.
